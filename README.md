A quick note since it seems some people have stumbled across this (woo!) -- I'm not done yet, that's why there isn't a readme :) But if you want to dig around in the mean time, I'm pulling a spreadsheet of locations into a fullscreen map with sheetsee.js and mapbox.js. The `key` variable on `index.html` is the spreadsheet key and Tabletop.js is turning it into lovely json.
